# LRC-Stopwatch

This is an application that I wrote for my IB Computing Science IA. Essentially it is a stopwatch mixed with a swimmer database. It is able to store infomation about swimmers
and their personal times. One feature that I am planning is the ability to update swimmers times with recorded times from the stopwatch.
