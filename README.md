# LRC-Stopwatch

This is an application that I wrote for my IB Computing Science IA. Essentially it is a stopwatch mixed with a swimmer database. It is able to store infomation about swimmers
and their personal times. ~~One feature that I am planning is the ability to update swimmers times with recorded times from the stopwatch.~~
I finished this application in April after five months of writing it. I satisfied all the requirements for the application that I set out with the only desired updates being to add the ability to record multiple swimmers at once, a meet calendar, and being able to organize swimmers.
